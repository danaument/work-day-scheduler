### <a name="Description">Description:</a>
This project serves as a homework assignment submission for the fifth week of UT's web dev coding bootcamp.  It contains a codebase and a deployed webpage for a day planner web app.

### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>

This assignment took me considerably less time to complete than previous assignments.  I had some issues understanding how and where to use some of the CSS class styles that were provided with the assignment. I ended up modifying them somewhat to make my app look as close to the provided gif as possible.  

I had originally intended to include all of my saved data values in session storage within an object, where each day got an object.  Perhaps I will add multiday support at some point in the future.  I had some difficulty with this object approach, and an askBCS learning assistant steered me toward using one session storage key per time slot.
